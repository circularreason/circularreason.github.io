## What education is NOT

* Education is NOT - mere job training (modern education)
* Education is NOT - producing revolutionaries to change the world (post modern)
* Education is NOT - mere repetition or preservation or conservation

* It is ... *formation*.

## Formation vs. Information

German: Education is ‘bildung’, formation, molding, sculpting; 
Greek: it is ethos or pae, enculturating, discipling, inheriting; 
Latin: it is educare (or paedia), drawing out, leading forth, cultivating, and gardening the soul. 
  
Information can be 'programmed' into the brain.
But formation takes time, care, love, and human connection. 
Formation must be divine-human, like Christ.

  ## Purification, illumination (what is education?)


* Education is an essential aspect of human life
* It is "the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to the next" (Chesterton)
* It is formation in basic life skills but so much more
* Formal fducation is a segmment (5-18) of one's whole life journey toward Christlikeness
* It is formation in the _thoughts_ and _sentiments_, the _wisdom_ and _virtues_ needed for success in life

### Mentor teachers

- Not: "What subjects are they learning all day?" but  "What type of person is your child with all day?" 
- Saintly and smart (NOT "cool", NOT "experts") 
- Parents are the best teachers
- Priests and professors can help!


</section><section data-markdown>

### Christian anthropology (what are we educating?)

  - What is a human being? An image bearer of God
  - What is God? The creator of human beings and (in the second person of the Trinity) one of us
  - All things were made by the Word, by Christ -- and the Word is our destiny, our end or purpose
  - A child is a saint in the making
  - God is loving, humble, wise, self-sacrificial -> so should teachers be, and so should they make their students

### Fr. Justin Popovich

Our life is deification — our life is *Christification.* 
Through being purified, illuminated, and united with Christ the human being struggles for his own salvation, by God’s grace. The result is no less than the shocking gift of union. Fr. Justin says: 
> “to become immortal in Him by the power of the Holy Spirit, to become God, to become the God-man — this is the purpose... of the human race...The purpose of man is to fill himself with the God-man, in His body—the Orthodox Church; to be transfigured in Him through grace-filled struggles.”

### Wisdom and love (why are we educating?) 

* So we learn all things in heaven and on earth
* In family, how to relate to people
* In church, how to relate to God and to pray
* In school, how to relate to concrete reality (our bodies, pencils, money, etc.)
    and abstract realities (like math, physics, history, statistics, and philosophy)

# Classical Education
  
  - We must create a little Eden, a little Sinai Desert, a little Bethleham, a little Gethsemane
  - Reading, writing, gardening, poetry, arithmetic, and art
  - The "Liberal arts" are truly well-rounded -- they are human and divine
  - Three aspects: Virtue, history, and wisdom
-   To be the complete man, we must pray with the spirit, and pray with the understanding also. (I Cor 14:15)
