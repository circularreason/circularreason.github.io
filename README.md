![github cat](https://technologyconversations.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/github.png?w=625)

This site is built by Keith Buhler more or less from scratch in plain text. It is hosted for free by the good folks at [Github](https://github.com). 


### Content

The content is written in plain text [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and stored on my hard-drive. 

When it's ready to publish, an amazing software called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) transforms the plain text files into HTML. 

The HTML which is  *hosted* and published for free by Github. Amazing. 


### Style

The core of the CSS design is the beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) by New York designer [Michael Rose.](https://mademistakes.com/) 


### Map

The site is constantly being revised and updated because of my ADD. The current iteration probably redirects to a live-updating Notion site.  which includes  some of my WRITINGS and other fun SANDBOX projects.


### Acknowledgments

I learned to write Markdown and how to use Github with major help from [Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com/), Jekyll, Michael Rose, and [W3Schools](www.w3schools.com). 


### Source Code 

You can view and even duplicate the source code on Github [by clicking here with the mouse machine](http://bit.ly/2lYmQsa).

### DIY

If you know programming, you can make your own similar website easily, over which you have total control. If you have zero programming experience, but you are tech-curious, you can do it. It will take some work. Start [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). 


### History

This site is my *ninth* draft. The [2013 first try](https://web.archive.org/web/20130511005256/http://keithbuhler.com) used GoDaddy's automatic one page builder and it was terrible. The [2015 second try](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217142037/http://keithbuhler.com/) with Web Zyro's automatic builder was also not great. Ultimately, I wanted more control over content and style, so I kept searching. 

[Dan Sheffler](http://www.dansheffler.com) showed me his site and got me started using Markdown. There was a learning curve, but I am tech curious and enjoyed the problem-solving. Over Christmas 2015, I worked compulsively on making the content and organization the data.  Versions 3-6 were failed attempts at using Github (first username was circularreason.github.io). Version 7 worked. Now it's a work in progress. 

Design-wise, I started with Dan Sheffler's site and made changes inspired by [Baron Peter Von Elswyk](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~pdv12/research.html) and [Andrew M. Bailey](http://www.andrewmbailey.com/). After learning a lot about CSS by building from the ground up, I started over with the very powerful and beautiful [Minimal Mistakes Layout](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) from New York designer Michael Rose, and have made slight changes from there. 

In May 2017, I made a major shift toward the "Less is More" layout because it had additional functionality for sub-menus in the masthead. Even though I sandboxed this transition, upon implementation it of course broke a bunch of things. I am still in the process of making the Less is More CSS play nicely with the Minimal Mistakes CSS. 

I was able to land a job in 2017, so I stopped updating the site until 2023. 

Now it's a simple landing page serving my revised career goals.
