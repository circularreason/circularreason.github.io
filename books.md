## [*Becoming What We Are*](/phd) 


![image](http://www.stenudd.com/greekphilosophers/images/pindar2.jpg)

A philosophy dissertation that defends moral realism and ethical naturalism. I dispute John McDowell's conception of "nature" in his version of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism and endorse Philippa Foot's conception in which virtue and practical wisdom are 'natural' for human beings. We are practical rational animals capable of reasoning, so we ought to become practically wise, despite varying abilities and life circumstances. The life of virtue is the life spent becoming what we are.

A modern day Platonic dialogue between an Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant Christians about Scripture and tradition.

>"Like the dialectic in real life, the discussion Buhler begins in 'Sola' does not end with the final page. He uses the written word as a way to encourage and direct readers who find themselves in aporia... By pointing to those bigger questions, Buhler invites the freader into the drama of the dialectic--of inquiring, analyzing, arguing, and hopefully falling more in love with Truth."

>"Buhler writes with Socratic humility."

>"This is a marvelous book. I highly recommend it... definitely will re-read."

>"This book is unlike any book I've ever read before (except for maybe Plato's writings)."
