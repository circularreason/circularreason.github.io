You're invited!

## What?
Saturday January 8th, from 9-11am, my brother and I will be giving two investment talks in one morning! Bring a friend!

<p></p>

# "A Whole Life Overview of Real Estate" - Keith Buhler
- How I started “house hacking” a duplex
- How I grew a portfolio of 2 units to 12 units within 18 months.
- How to conceive of investing on a spectrum: “side money”, retirement, wage replacement, philanthropy
- How to change your perspective to “value add” — in real estate, in your own home, in yourself

<p></p>
<p></p>

# "Bitcoin 101" - Kevin Buhler

- Why I started buying Bitcoin 8 years ago
- What I’ve learned in the rollercoaster
- The history of money
- Bitcoin’s three revolutions: technological, monetary, and freedom
- The causes and dangers of inflation

<p></p>
<p></p>

# Why? 
* This is not a sales pitch, professional advice, or sensational
* No entry fee, no costs, no sales pitches! 
>Just information to enrich yourself and others. 
>We love learning and sharing what we are learning. This is an informal presentation of what we have been studying, thinking about, and putting in to action for the last decade. 

# Who? 
For this reason, our ideal guest is: 
- Curious
- Interested
- Maybe has dabbled in trading crypto
- Has researched a bit but wants to know more
- Maybe has invested in real estate but wants to know more

(I.e., if you have an axe to grind about alt-coins or Bitcoin or apartments or RV parks, or if you want to warn us or share your worst experiences, if you can't respectfully listen through the whole talk, this is not for you!)
