Merry Christmas from Keith, Lindsay, Josiah (9), Evelyn (7), Karis (3), and David (1) Buhler

# Merry Christmas 2021!

It's been a couple of years since our last newsletter. Something happened to distract us in 2020 — I don't want to mention it but it rhymes with "Pomona Cyrus". 

Here's a few updates on the Buhler fam. 

## We have moved!

In June, we packed up from Santa Clarita (CA) and moved to Riverside (CA). Our new address is 787 Hacienda Dr. Riverside CA 92507. We're really enjoying renting this house from a friend, having a yard, and an extra bedroom for the kids. And Riverside has some amazing hikes, trails, and parks.

## New job

The occasion for the move was that Keith has started a new job as founding headmaster of Saint Andrew Academy. Building an Orthodox Christian academy has been a dream of ours for many years. Working with the Saint Andrew parish, this dream came true! 

Keith was on the education board of the church as an advisor since March 2019. The church has been planning to launch an educational program for years. The conversations developed in the direction of Keith actually helping to found the program. So since about February of 2020, he spearheaded the massive effort, coordinating with 30+ others to plan and found a new educational non-profit. Since September 2021, we've been holding classes in person. Keith is teaching 2 classes and doing full-time administration the rest of the week. Our kids (Josiah and Evelyn) are Academy students as well!

Needless to say, this move was a God thing. Lindsay is volunteering in several capacities at the Academy, the kids are thriving, and Keith feels God’s direction and blessing over this new endeavor. We're also overjoyed to be so close to a wonderful church community, in a house! Couldn't be more grateful. 

## Milestones

David is 15 months: walking and beginning to talk more. He knows "amen" and "Yeeya" (Jesus) from all the singing we do — as well as "mama," "dada", "hot", "light" and a few others. He gives hugs, kisses, and even blows kisses. He's definitely the mascot for the Academy; all the older kids love him!

Karis is 3 going on 5. She loves to play with big sister, wrestle, dress up, and sing. She has no idea she's not a big girl yet, and tells people with a big smile "Soon I'm going to be a mom." I ask her "how soon?" and she just repeats, "Soon." I hope not too soon my girl!

Evelyn is turning 7 two days after Christmas. She's just about as tall as Josiah and enjoys reading, jumping on the trampoline, stretching, and drawing. She's in 1st grade at Saint Andrew Academy and is loving her new friends and new subjects. 

Josiah is 9 and in 3rd grade. He still enjoys drawing and doodling like he did last year, but has some new 'drawing buddies' in his class. Between them, they've drawn a quite extensive catalogs of dragons, monsters, and Eldritch horrors (below). When he's not doodling monsters though, he is doing still life in art class (right).

A still life from class. 

All in all we are proud of these little guys and love watching them grow.

Lindsay is still working for Redfin on the weekends. She has been enjoying assisting in the childcare for the Academy, as well as running the uniforms, and doing project planning, and substitute teaching. She's loving her new book club and hitting the gym now that David is old enough to be watched in the gym nursery. 

Keith has been pretty busy getting the Academy up and running but is starting to get a good handle on things. He's using a new productivity system (Notion) to keep his tasks and projects organized. He's focusing on simplifying life, enjoying each day, and living in the moment, being grateful for everything that happens — blessings and challenges. 

Let us know what's going on in your life, we'd love to hear from you. Christ is Born! Glorify Him!

Love, the Buhlers
