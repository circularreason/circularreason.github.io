You're invited to a 

Bitcoin Double Header

Two investment talks in one event. 

# "A Whole Life Overview of Real Estate" - Keith Buhler
- How I started “house hacking” a duplex
- How I grew a portfolio of 2 units to 12 units within 18 months.
- How to conceive of investing on a spectrum: “side money”, retirement, wage replacement, philanthropy
- How to change your perspective to “value add” — in real estate, in your own home, in yourself

# "Bitcoin 101" - Kevin Buhler

- Why I started buying Bitcoin 8 years ago
- What I’ve learned in the rollercoaster
- The history of money
- Bitcoin’s three revolutions: technological, monetary, and freedom
- The causes and dangers of inflation

# What this talk *is not*

No entry fee, no costs, no sales pitches! 

Just information to enrich yourself and others. 

We love learning and sharing what we are learning. This is an informal presentation of what we have been studying, thinking about, and putting in to action for the last decade. 

For this reason, our ideal guest is: 
- Curious
- Interested
- Maybe has dabbled in trading crypto
- Has researched a bit but wants to know more
- Maybe has invested in real estate but wants to know more

If you have an axe to grind about alt-coins or Bitcoin, if you want to warn us or share your worst experiences, if you can't respectfully listen through the whole talk, this is not for you! 

# The next event is ...
* Saturday, January 8th
* 9-11am
* Canyon Crest Business Center, Riverside CA

# RSVP by Jan 7th to Keith Buhler (keithedbuhler@gmail.com)
Feel free to invite a friend!

Thank you!
