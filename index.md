Thank you for visiting. 

I'm Keith Buhler, a philosopher and classical educator. I'm currently the founding headmaster of a new classical academy in Southern California.

## About me

My life mission is to help people of all ages to pursue virtue and wisdom.  The pursuit of wisdom informs my teaching, coaching, and other activities.  

In my day job, I'm a headmaster at a [classical Christian school](https://classicalchristian.org/) and an academic philosopher with a special interest in virtue ethics. 

In other areas of the classical education renewal, I serve as a board member of another classical schools and recently became an [Alcuin Fellow](http://www.alcuinfellowship.com/) (West Coast chapter). 

When possible, I teach online philosophy courses for Asbury University. 

Virtue is possible but it requires hard work and practice. We *all* need to "try on" the practical skills that bring about human flourishing, even if we wobble and sometimes fail. These skills include listening well, being proactive, self-discipline, serving others, prayer, and spiritual discipline. 






## Previous Activity

I've developed and implementied a [10th grade philosophy course](http://www.keithbuhler.com/trinity-philosophy/) introducing students to Plato and Aristotle by reading the whole *Republic* and the whole *Nicomachean Ethics*, as well as teaching them to write and argue using the medieval "disputatio" format (a la Aquinas).  

In 2018, I gave a lecture entitled ["Philosophy for Everyone" at Trinity Classical Academy,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMvlTUVFf4M&t=137s) introducing our community to the nature and value of philosophy. 
<br> 

Last summer, I spoke at [the ACCS conference on "Assessing for Virtue".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovzMF-znsN8&t=2394s) and received positive feedback from the 120 teachers, admin, and parents in attendance.  

Around the same time, I had the privilege of [interviewing Dr. Robert George of Princeton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDdJiyDnaY&t=10s) for my YouTube channel. 

Before that, I did audio interviews with [Eric Silverman, David Bradshaw, and JP Moreland](http://www.advicetochristianphilosophers.com/) for my Christian Philosophers podcast.

## Prior Work

In 2017, completed a philosophy book (as of yet unpublished), titled [Becoming What We Are](/phd). It defends Aristotle's ethics in light of scientific naturalism -- and offers a tendentious definition of scientific naturalism. 

In 2012, I published a my first book, *Sola Scriptura*, a [Platonic dialogue](http://bitly.com/ScriptureOrTradition) consisting of of various Christians discussing Scripture and Tradition.
