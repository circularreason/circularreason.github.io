Are you ready to start a Classical Christian School? 

Or are you already part of a school that is tired, deadlocked, running low on funds, or getting weird? 

I'm Keith Buhler and my mission is to advance Christian education throughout the nation and the world. 

We need more, high quality, sustainable schools -- not later, now!

I founded a parochial school at an Orthodox Church in CA. 

Classical education changed my life. My mentors introduced me classical education in college after dropping out of high school. 

I've been teaching since 2007 and in leadership since 2020. Now I'm coaching, consulting, and fundraising for Christian schools (especially Orthodox home schools, private schools.)

I'm an Alcuin Fellow at SCL and a regular speaker/podcaster. 

I'm also big into fundraising. We need to be able to pay teachers a living wage (with perks!) and include parents and families who don't *believe* they can afford private education. 

Donors and backers can use real estate investments to leverage the dollars donated to support our schools. If and when the government schools (which are failing) implode and school choice becomes the norm, then our hard-earned tax dollars can support *everyone* -- until then we pay for it ourselves. 

Every student needs to pursue virtue. To become wise in this crazy world requires wise teachers. Parents are a great start but children need mentors outside of the home too. 

That means classical, Christian education. Falling in love with beauty. Having fun with logical thinking. Extreme devotion to moderation. 

Living well is a skill. Happiness is a skill. It's an activity we can get better at. As adults, we lead the way for our children. 


Thanks for vising, let me know how I can help you.
