Here's a really important question: What's the potential downside? What's the worst case scenario? What bad thing could happen if I act?

Here's an even more important question: What's the potential upside? What's the best case scenario? What bad thing could happen if I *don't* act?

Look for the good ("be the bee"), see the good, emphasize the good, notice what's noble, think on what is beautiful.

And, as a corollary, look for the best case scenario, the highest potential upside, and let that factor into your risk analysis. If the good is great enough, it's worth a great risk.
